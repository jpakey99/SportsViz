"1","16","1/BAL","Adley Rutschman","C","21.3388888","6' 2""","216","S","R","Oregon State",,"60",,"Rutschman began to ascend the fall after his freshman year, when he looked like one of the two most talented Oregon State players during fall practices in Corvallis. He then broke out as a sophomore, and further separated himself from the rest of the top talents with an electrifying 2018 postseason. He held the top spot, wire-to-wire, during the subsequent 12 months, which included him hitting .427/.584/.772 as a junior. It's because Rustchman is good at everything. Remarkably mobile for someone his size, he comfortably has the skills to not only stay at catcher, but excel there. He's an agile ball-blocker, he can throw, and he's a con artist pitch-framer who gets umpires booed because fans are convinced they're all strikes. On top of that, this is a switch-hitter with both power and feel for contact from both sides of the plate and an intense, earnest, vocal leader. He is arguably the best draft prospect of the last half decade, a polished, complete player with star-level physical tools. Unless Baltimore wants to save bonus pool money or Rutschman's medical raises questions (it may -- he had a shoulder issues in high school and again as a sophomore), he should be their pick.",,

Abrams, one of the most precocious talents in this class. There was some concern early in the summer when he was swinging through fastballs in the zone that this could be a 40 bat that goes lower in the first round, but he rebounded well in the fall and spring. It's still a power-over-hit profile along the lines of Trevor Story but Witt may be a better athlete, runner, and defender than Story as well. He's now securely the consensus second-best prospect in the draft class.",,

Bleday","RF","21.5777777","6' 3""","205","L","L","Vanderbilt",,"50",,"Bleday was an interesting but low-to-mid-six-figure two-way prospect out of a Florida panhandle high school, with mostly average tools on the mound and at the plate. He gave up pitching and began to emerge as a power threat at Vanderbilt as an underclassman, then had a coming out party on the Cape and early this spring, jumping into the top 10. He slowly climbed up from there as his quirky setup seemed less problematic as he torched the SEC with a flat BB/K rate and 25 homers while also offering more than just a cursory level of outfield defense.",,
"4","65","3/CHW","Andrew Vaughn","1B","21.1805555","5' 11""","210","R","R","Cal",,"50",,"Vaughn hit .402/.531/.819 as a sophomore and won the Golden Spikes. A repeat performance as a junior would have made him one of, if not the greatest statistical performer in college history. After an early-season surge, Vaughn started seeing a lot of breaking balls, about 15% fewer fastballs in PAC-12 play than he had during non-conference bouts. He was pitched around, and unable to make as much impact contact. But all the tools remain present. Vaughn has a very selective approach, letting strikes he can't drive pass him by unless he has to protect. He has a very athletic swing despite being decidedly unathletic in every other way, enabling all fields power and high rates of contact. There's no margin for error for right-handed hitting first baseman, but if there's one prospect to be confident in hitting as much as is necessary to profile at first base, it's someone with this combination of visual evaluation and statistical track record. He's a longshot possibility at the first pick, but probably goes between three and five.","cPv9SsBcKQk",
"5","85","6/SDP","C.J. Abrams","SS","18.6805555","6' 2""","182","L","R","Blessed Trinity HS GA","Alabama","50",,"Abrams stood out early in his high school career and colleges that recruited him regarded him as too talented to get to campus as early as age 15. He's developed into an 80 runner with 55-grade raw power that many think will turn into a 60 down the road. He's okay at shortstop mainly because the actions and instincts aren't present, so most think he moves to center field down the road. The swing is geared for line drives and has mechanical similarities to Kenny Lofton's. Most clubs regard Abrams as more of a 50 makeup guy (admittedly a subjective distinction) who has questionable enthusiasm for the game, but at some point, his near historic raw tools and strong track record are too much to pass up.",,
"6","92","5/DET","Riley Greene","RF","18.6944444","6' 2""","190","L","L","Hagerty HS FL","Florida","50",,"Greene, like so many elite prep bats, was identified early in his prep career as an elite bat, but unlike many of those, he always looked like a corner fit. The consensus tool grades are a 55 or 60 bat with 60 raw power and a good feel for hitting in games and getting to his power. He got in better shape and trained to improve his straight line speed, becoming a 50 runner this spring, so there's a little more speed and defense than there was in the summer. A common comp is the last advanced prep corner outfielder, Twins prospect Alex Kirilloff.",,
"7","111","7/CIN","Nick Lodolo","LHP","21.3416666","6' 6""","195","L","L","TCU",,"50",,"Drafted and unsigned by the Pirates as a 2016 first rounder, Lodolo took a bit of a circuitous route to the top of the 2019 class. He had iffy freshman and sophomore years but flashed a tantalizing blend of stuff and feel at times, keeping him in the first round mix despite inconsistent performance. Everything clicked for him during an early-season college tournament in Houston, where Lodolo worked in the mid-90s with a plus breaking ball and changeup. He generally sits 92-94, but he is lanky 6-foot-6, so it plays up a bit due to extension. He's more apt to throw his curveball for strikes rather than bury it in the dirt for swings and misses, but he showed better grasp of the latter late in the year. While Lodlo will sometimes go entire outings without throwing many changeups, there have been stretches where it's his best pitch. His frame is ideal, his delivery elegant and repeatable. The stuff isn't dominant, but some teams are still projecting on it because of how big and lean Lodolo's frame is, and they think it might be eventually.","pIYt1wwMfI0",
"8",,"12/NYM","Brett Baty","3B","19.5694444","6' 3""","210","L","R","Lake Travis HS TX","Texas","45+",,"In an age when more and more teams are taking model-driven approaches to building a draft board, Baty's age looms large. A player's age relative to his peers is a predictive variable for pro success (younger is better) and Baty is older than a lot of last year's high scohol draftees. Not older than they were on draft day. Older than they are right now, and Baty is two years older than Day 1 prospect Kyren Paris. But tools-wise, he compares quite closely to Cardinals 2018 first rounder and top 100 prospect Nolan Gorman, and those tools belong in the middle of the first round. Baty is big, strong, and has huge power and advanced feel to hit. He may not be an athletic fit at third base, especially long term, and is at risk of moving to first. The age issue slides him a shade beneath where we had Gorman's FV last year, and we consider Baty's first pro summer, probably at an advanced rookie affiliate, to be of greater than usual importance in assessing his skills in an age-appropriate competitive environment.",,
"9",,"16/ARI","Corbin Carroll","CF","18.7972222","5' 10""","165","L","L","Lakeside HS WA","UCLA","45+",,"Carroll was electric during his showcase summer, displaying consistent, high-quality, all-fields contact and surprising power. In addition to having plus pure speed, which will enable him to stay in center field, Carroll is also a sly, instinctive baserunner who presses action. He doesn't run on many balls and probably won't hit for home run power without a significant swing adjustment, which it may not be pertinent to make because Carroll is such a good hitter. He has a small, narrow frame that concerns some teams, but we think the requisite strength to make hard contact and stand up to a 162-game grind is present.","sUghxoNDJ4g",
"10",,"10/SFG","Hunter Bishop","CF","20.9527777","6' 5""","210","L","R","Arizona State",,"45+",,"Bishop changed his college commitment late (he was originally going to play two sports at Washington), and headed to ASU. After struggling as a freshman and sophomore, he arrived for his junior season with a better body and quieter swing. He sent many non-conference pitches rocketing into Phoenix's midnight sky before he started seeing -- and swinging over top of -- lots of Pac-12 breaking balls. Whether this is fixable has been the subject of many debates in draft rooms in the early first round. Bishop has rare physical tools for a college hitter. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion with solid feel for center field and huge, playable power, so there's a chance for stardom here even if Bishop ends up with a below-average hit tool. It's unclear why Bishop's arm strength and accuracy became issues this year after they were assets earlier in his career, but it's such a small aspect of his skillset that it shouldn't be a concern unless his medical indicates it's a chronic issue. Less stable than the college hitters ranked above him, Bishop has as much upside.",,
"11",,"14/PHI","Bryson Stott","SS","21.6722222","6' 3""","195","L","R","UNLV",,"45+",,"Teams fall into one of three groups when evaluating Stott. There are teams that think, despite his size and atypical throwing stroke, that he'll stay at shortstop and hit for some power. Those teams are highest on him. Then there are teams that think he'll just do one of those and, finally, those who think he'll do neither. His swing is geared for low ball contact, and he hits pitches near his shoetops to all fields, with power. But the swing's length and bat path creates doubt that Stott will get to velocity up and/or in. Lefty-hitting shortstops with power are rare, and Stott has a shot to be one, but he's riskier than is typical for a college bat who has two years of strong numbers.",,
"12",,"8/TEX","Josh Jung","3B","21.3222222","6' 2""","215","R","R","Texas Tech",,"45+",,"If he's going to get to all of his considerable raw power, then Jung (pronounced 'young') is probably going to need a swing change that enables him to pull the ball more consistently. He inside outs an awful lot of pitches, though Jung's strength and feel to hit enables a high quality of contact despite this. He's a .346/.452/.562 career hitter at Tech and has more walks than strikeouts over the past two years. Originally thought to be a risk to move to first base, Jung not only allayed those concerns but also played a passable college shortstop this season. He comfortably projects to third base in pro ball. He's a potential everyday player and likely goes somewhere in the middle of the first round.","RlBShzGPoCY",
"13",,"11/TOR","Alek Manoah","RHP","21.4138888","6' 6""","250","R","R","West Virginia",,"45+",,"Manoah is a big-bodied late bloomer from South Florida who wasn't a top notch recruit but developed into an elite prospect in his sophomore year in Morgantown. He took a softer 6-foot-6, 270 body and got in better shape for the spring, and it took a high effort relief type into a possible workhorse mid-rotation starter. Manoah still stands out for his fastball/slider combo and the changeup and command are around average, so it may be more of a power multi-inning arm than a true 200-inning starter, but his two best features are also TrackMan friendly. This means that progressive clubs see a quick-moving arm with Lance McCullers-type qualities, and traditional ones see someone they could mold into a power starter.","xjl8MA97TKA",
"14",,"9/ATL","Shea Langeliers","C","21.5555555","6' 0""","190","R","R","Baylor",,"45",,"Langeliers was a mid-tier prospect in high school and took a big step forward as a freshman at Baylor, developing the raw power to be more than just a catch-and-throw type. He still didn't put up much in the way of traditional high-end production until the second half of his draft year, after a quick return from a broken hamate bone. Langeliers' frame is compact and stout, and his bat's impact is a question mark, but the tools are here for an impact starter.",,
"15",,"15/LAA","Will Wilson","2B","20.8805555","6' 0""","175","R","R","North Carolina State",,"45",,"Wilson doesn't have the traditional markers to go this high: medium frame, average tools, backward K/BB ratio. That said, he's a plus makeup guy who many scouts think can go behind the plate akin to some recent Dodgers multi-positional catchers, he gets the most out of his swing with a progressive, power-based approach, he's been super productive, and he's young for his class. It's probably a 50 or 55 PV at his peak, but Wilson is the versatile intagibles-heavy type who winning teams have on the roster.",,
"16",,"25/LAD","Kody Hoese","3B","21.9027777","6' 4""","200","R","R","Tulane",,"45",,"Hoese was just a name on a list of guys to monitor this spring unti March when the scouting community sat up and recognized the insane statistical season he was putting up. After putting up an .803 OPS in his draft-eligible sophomore year (he went in the 35th round and didn't sign), he put up a 1.276 OPS in his junior year, with 23 homers and a 38/30 BB/K ratio. While he's 6-foot-4, 200 pounds and a late-bloomer, he projects to be an average defender with an average arm at shortstop and has the bat speed to project continued performance at higher levels. There's a posture issue to fix in his swing, but clubs will be wary of trying to change too much while everything is going well.",,
"17",,"18/PIT","Quinn Priester","RHP","18.7305555","6' 3""","190","R","R","Cary-Grove HS IL","TCU","45",,"Priester was another early-identified prospect, standing out for his projection, athleticism, and average stuff as an underclassman from a northern locale. His stuff was mostly 50 or 55 on the summer circuit, with some buzz in the spring that he'd come out strong with firmer stuff. In late starts with a couple dozen high-level scouts packed in behind home, he would start games at 92-96 mph, and mix in a curveball and changeup that have flashed above average potential. He checks the boxes of clean medical, delivery, arm action, and mid-rotation stuff with feel. He's in the general area of Ian Anderson and Matthew Liberatore, he just didn't show multiple plus pitches for over a year like those guys did.",,

He belongs there on stuff and pitchability. In fact, he's a much better touch and feel pitcher than Manoah and Rutledge, deftly spotting his changeup on the corners and setting up both of his breaking balls with intelligent fastball location. He has a four-pitch mix and knows how to use it, he's athletic, and throws hard. He'll likely come off the baord in the middle of round one.",,
"19",,"20/SEA","George Kirby","RHP","21.3333333","6' 4""","210","R","R","Elon",,"45",,"Kirby had a very loud performance this spring, twirling 107 strikeouts to six walks in 88 innings for Elon. He's got at least above average command and plus control along with a plus fastball that works 91-96 and touches 97 mph. He's got a good frame and no medical hiccups but his offspeed stuff is often just average, with the curveball flashing 55 at times and the changeup usually solid average at best. It's a No. 3/4 starter profile that's valued most by clubs that like performance and fastball quality/command as a leading characteristic.",,
"20",,"89/NYM","Matthew Allan","RHP","18.1416666","6' 3""","210","R","R","Seminole HS FL","Florida","45",,"Allan was one of the top few pitchers in the class for a while, including all summer. He flashed 55 or 60 with all three pitches in short stints at multiple events, then came out this spring with more arm speed, sitting 93-96 and hitting 97 mph in most of his starts. His curveball also ticked up and flashed 65 or 70 on his best outings, and though he didn't throw his changeup much in high school, it did flash 55 over the summer. Allan isn't very projectable and is an average athlete, while his command has been consistently below average with this higher octane stuff, so some teams worry this is a classic prep righty bust where clubs fall in love with the raw stuff. His velo would also sit 90-93 at times down the stretch and some teams are worried there could be a minor medical hiccup, which, combined with Allan's $4 million pricetag and committment to Florida, could make him the second most likely prep player in the draft to go to college behind Jack Leiter.",,

He's a physical beast with some of the best velocity and breaking stuff in the draft, but there are questions about his build, athleticism, and injured hips. Despite lacking a changeup, Rutledge has the pitch mix and pitch utility to start. In addition to solid east/west fastball command, he can drop his curveball in the zone for strikes and back foot either of his breaking balls to lefties. Several teams in the eight through 14 range had Rutledge in their mix as the draft approached.",,

He may have the best frame in the entire draft but has already grown into considerable power, which he gets to in games despite an awkwardly-timed stride. At times clumsy on defense, Cavaco may still be growing into his new body. He may end up at second or third base (where he played as an amateur) or get a try in center field if his hands and actions don't improve. He's one of the draft's higher risk, higher reward prospects.",,

He really took a step forward this spring after transferring to IMG Academy in Bradenton, FL from his home in North Carolina. Similar to how Touki Toussaint has evolved, Malone switched to a more controllable verison of his breaker, a 55-grade slider that he can dot anywhere. Malone still works 93-96 and hit 99 mph in his last outing of the spring in front of a lot of heat. His curveball and changeup are both about average and his performance against strong competition this spring helps him with progressive clubs that aggressively chart prep outings.",,

He's dabbled with catching a bit but scouts don't think there's much upside there, projecting him to play third base in pro ball, and due to his boxy frame, possibly moving to first base eventually. The selling point here is a bat that almost every scout projects as a 55 or 60 hit tool and game power, too, with 60 raw and loud performance against good pitching for a year. He's old for the class and has a limited upside, with only a little margin for error between here and being a platoon first baseman, but the track record of advanced hit/power prep prospects is solid.",,

He had a slow start this spring and has been a little tougher to see than the typical prospect in the southeast, because you have to fly to Puerto Rico the day before and then only get one game a day, when you could easily have 5-6 quality games if you hung around major metro areas like Atlanta or Orlando for the same period. Lugo has interest as high as St. Louis at 19, and likely goes by the Arizona picks at 33 and 34.",,

He's a big, switch-hitting 6-foot-3 shortstop who can stick at the position in pro ball and has above average raw power from both sides. The issue is that he hasn't hit well with wood bats over the summer and has always had plenty of strikeouts to go with his homers in the spring (42 career HR, 20% career strikeouts). Some scouts worry that he'll be more of a 30-35 bat in pro ball who doesn't get to his power, making him a utility guy, while others see another candidate for an offensive adjustment that could make him a 45 bat, 55 power standout everyday player.","CIxwpUggH0Y",

The power is huge -- a future 70 for some scouts -- and he's an above average to plus runner underway and was in the first round on most boards entering the spring, where he started hot and got top 10 momentum. As he entered SEC play, the only time he's even been watched closely against strong pitching, Misner wasn't good. He posted a .668 OPS with 21/39 BB/K ratio in 131 plate appearance. His swing flaw is tied to a toe tap he uses for timing, which has been terrible against mid-90s stuff since he stays back/coiled so long that his stride length/power varies swing to swing and he has no rhythm. Misner is now 21 with no track record of success against strong pitching his age, but with rare tools, so he's closer to a popup prep bat than most college bats in terms of risk and the information clubs possess to make decisions.",,

That style of swinging is appealing to many teams, though, as it makes it likely that he'll hit for power in games.

That alone is enough to go on the first day if the health checks out, which Espino's does. The neutral aspect is that he's a maxed-out 6-foot-2, 200 pounds. The negative aspect is a very long arm stroke and as you might guess, a power approach rather than fine command. No prep prospect can be everything as an 18-year-old but Espino's velocity was 95-98, touching 100 this spring in early starts with lots of rest and was more 92-96 touching 97 when on normal rest. Pitchers lose velocity as they age, so many teams prefer a more conventional delivery and arm stroke, and a pitcher with average stuff and good feel who can grow into power stuff, rather than a power pitcher who has to learn feel only when his stuff declines. The recent track record of prep pitchers who hit 98-100 before the draft is riddled with injuries and command regression. With prep pitching being so subject to specific team tastes to try to avoid busts and attrition, many teams are out on Espino on Day 1 and others, particularly the more progressive clubs that value velo, spin rate, high octane stuff in shorter stints, and area control with that stuff, are interested in the 20s and 30s.",,

We saw him late when he was opening 90-93, cruising 88-91, and reaching back for 93 when he needed it. Walston is young for the class, is ultra projectable, is an above average athlete, and throws two versions of his curveball with the harder slurve flashing 65- or 70-grade when it's on while the slow one is a consistent 60.

He'll be a tough sign, but teams who think he could be a true two-way player may be motivated to pay him. He'll sit in the upper-80s on the mound and has a great curveball. Offensively, Jones already has considerable power and will likely grow into more. He's also a massive, athletic target at first base.",,
"38",,"30/NYY","Anthony Volpe","SS","18.1111111","5' 11""","180","R","R","Delbarton HS NJ","Vanderbilt","45",,"The steadiest infield defender in the class, Volpe compares similarly to Oakland A's shortstop, Nick Allen, when he was a high schooler. Volpe will likely be a plus shortstop defender and has good feel for contact, but he lacks strength and physical projection that enables teams to anticipate it will come. He also reportedly wants about $3 million to sign, which is too rich for lots of teams and much more than Allen got a couple years ago. Volpe may end up at school, but if he signs he projects as a low-end shortstop regular.",,
"39",,"55/LAA","Kyren Paris","SS","17.575","6' 0""","170","R","R","Freedom HS CA","California","40+",,"Paris is closer in age to many international free agent prospects than he is to some of the older high schoolers in this draft. He is fast, capable of staying at shortstop, and has one of the more projectable frames in the class. Paris' showcase summer contact was middling, but better the following spring. Some teams think it's just a product of facing weaker pitching; others think he's truly emerging and cite his age as evidence that late improvement is legitimate. Draft models that factor in age likely have Paris very high on some teams' boards, probably in the late first round mix.",,
"40",,"42/BAL","Gunnar Henderson","3B","17.9416666","6' 3""","195","L","R","Morgan Academy HS AL","Auburn","40+",,"Henderson has late helium to multiple teams in the teens but may fall more into the late 20s or 30s, which is where most scouts have him. He's shown performance at times, but faced weak competition this spring, so some clubs are still skeptical about the offensive ceiling. He's a shortstop for now, though he more likely shifts to third base down the line. But he's young-for-the-class and offers five tools that are 50 or 55.",,
"41",,"62/COL","Aaron Schunk","3B","21.8722222","6' 2""","203","R","R","Georgia",,"40+",,"Schunk is yet another college swing change candidate. He has above average to plus defensive ability and arm strength to the point where some scouts think he may also be able to catch. Schunk also pitches in the low-90's in relief for a loaded Georgia squad. His offensive approach is mostly line drive/grounders to the opposite field, but he has 15-20 homer raw power if he would pull and lift the ball more. His approach is solid and may also benefit from a professional approach, so teams see upside beyond the wide base of tools and solid performance.",,
"42",,"718/NYM","Hunter Barco","LHP","18.4805555","6' 4""","208","L","L","Bolles HS FL","Florida","40+",,"Barco was on the radar early and drawing comps to lower-slot elite lefties in the draft like Madison Bumgarner did when he was a prep underclassman. His velo was around 88-91 with a lower slot most of the showcase circuit, then he showed mostly 90-93, touching 96 mph this spring, sometimes flashing a consistently solid average breaker and at other times struggling to land it. His low-spin splitter is a true plus pitch if not closer to 70. He was shut down late in the season with a shoulder muscle strain but hit 96 mph in a private workout with Milwaukee, so the health scare looks to be behind him. Clubs that like the separator splitter, two-way athleticism, and deceptive velo will bet they can figure out the command/breaker, while others see a lefty with inconsistent stuff and arm slot who relies on a splitter.",,
"43",,"47/DET","Nick Quintana","3B","21.6527777","6' 0""","185","R","R","Arizona",,"40+",,"A very prominent high school prospect, Quintana matriculated to Arizona and became a core of their lineup almost immediately. Though his swing is somewhat grooved, he's an athletic swinger with power who is also quite good at third base. He's in the mix for teams picking 30-50, with Boston and Arizona as rumored landing spots.",,
"44",,"39/MIN","Matt Wallner","RF","21.4888888","6' 4""","220","L","R","Southern Mississippi",,"40+",,"Wallner hit for power all three years of college, even while pitching part time as a freshman and sophomore. He has some of the most explosive raw thump in the entire class, and will hit balls 10 rows into the bleachers even when he doesn't get fully extended. He has some moderate swing-and-miss issues characteristic of hitters who have power-driven approaches, but he's also willing to take a walk. His is a traditional right field profile, and he's in the mix with late first, early second round college power bats.",,
"45",,"32/HOU","Korey Lee","C","20.8694444","6' 1""","205","R","R","Cal",,"40+",,"Lee no doubt benefitted from decision makers picking in the top five to 10 coming in to see Andrew Vaughn, as his name seems to be in the mix at many of those teams' second picks. He's a stocky, athletic catcher with a fine arm, and surprising bat speed and power. He hit .320/.420/.626 this year, emerging as a likely Day 1 selection. Lee hasn't caught a lot of pro-quality stuff at Cal, so that part of his skillset remains somewhat unclear, but we think he's athletic enough to improve if it's initially an issue.",,
"46",,"23/COL","Michael Toglia","1B","20.8111111","6' 4""","205","S","L","UCLA",,"40+",,"He didn't have the statistical season we hoped/anticipated he would, but Toglia remains a rare sort of prospect. He's a switch-hitter with power from both sides of the plate, who is also a plus defender at first base. He got hot late in the year, but was probably already too far out of the first round mix to have climbed back in, though he may be a comp round target.",,
"47",,"683/SDP","Maurice Hampton","CF","17.8527777","6' 0""","195","R","R","Memphis University HS TN","LSU","40+",,"Hampton was a hot name over the summer for his loud, 105+ mph batted balls and his big time tools and model-friendly age at 17.9 on draft day. This spring, teams have continues to doubt his ability to hit, with a raw feel to hit that some think may never come all the way around, but power/speed/defense to still project as a low-end regular without a 50+ hit tool.",,
"48",,"43/BOS","Cameron Cannon","3B","21.6444444","5' 10""","196","R","R","Arizona",,"40+",,"Two years of elite statistical performance -- including a .390/.480/.640 line as a junior -- and more walks than strikeouts will have Cannon in the second or third round. He can't play shortstop, but has a shot to play second or third. Perhaps most interestingly, he has hit as well has he has despite very conservative use of his lower half, something that might be changed to enable him to hit with more power in pro ball.",,
"49",,"137/BOS","**Noah Song","RHP","22.0277777","6' 4""","200","R","R","Navy",,"40+",,"The way teams value Song depends on whether or not they feel confident the U.S. Department of Defense will re-write service academy athlete policy. Currently, Song must complete two years of Naval service. This administration may reinstate an Obama-era rule that allows athletes to petition for an exemption to pursue sports. If that rule were currently in place, Song would go in the top 50. He throws hard, attacks hitters with his fastball and slider, and will mix in the occasional knee-buckling, rainbow curveball. If teams think Song will have to serve and thus won't be able to pitch again until he's 24, he'll fall to Day 3.",,
"50",,"34/ARI","Drey Jameson","RHP","21.8083333","6' 0""","165","R","R","Ball State",,"40+",,"In front of a huge contingent of scouts, Jameson carved up Stanford in his first start of the 2019 season and was immediately on the map as a draft-eligible sophomore. His high-maintenance delivery is hard to repeat, but it also makes things awkward for hitters, who don't typically see this kind of arm slot/release point. And from that release point emerges nasty stuff. Jameson will touch 98, he manipulates the shape of two good breaking balls, and he'll flash an occasional plus changeup. The delivery may make it hard for him to start and Jameson has a skinny, atypical frame. Some teams think he ends up in relief, but it may be a multi-inning or high-leverage role.","JQEvZJZktbE",
