"1","33","DET/1","Casey Mize","RHP","21.1","6' 3""","208","R","R","Auburn","","55","Med","Mize was a semi-sought-after high schooler but ended up at Auburn, where he broke out on the Cape after his freshman year. He looked like a mid-first rounder after his sophomore year and subsequent summer with collegiate Team USA, then took a giant leap forward this year, as a junior, when his command improved and because he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch. 

While he threw a sinker most of 2017, Mize now throws a flat four-seamer, up to 97 mph in most starts, but he doesn't throw it much compared to big league norms. In starts we've charted, Mize threw 37% fastballs, 32% cutters, 16% splitters and 15% sliders. 

Mize is unique, a nearly finished product who could probably pitch in the upper levels of the minors now, and maybe be in a rotation next year, pitching in a way that's becoming more common in the big leagues. On the down side, Mize has some head violence at release and no physical projection and also relies heavily on a new pitch (the cutter) where there's lots of anecdotal evidence that says it dimishes velocity when used often.

Discussions of Mize's presumptive selection at #1 overall are always qualified by assumptive health. Mize had shoulder issues in high school that scared some teams off, he missed two starts as a sophomore with forearm tightness and experienced more forearm issues last summer with Team USA, then had non-surgical treatment on the arm in August of last year. He's still our top prospect, but by a smaller margin that some may expect, because he's a risky subset of pitcher. He's also very advanced and should move quickly, and this class lacks a standout, consensus bat to stick ahead of him. The Tigers have been zeroed in on Mize most of the spring and he's the overwhelming favorite to go 1-1.","KTLpXoKizJU",""
"2","35","CHW/4","Nick Madrigal","2B","21.2","5' 7""","160","R","R","Oregon State","","55","Low","Madrigal had his share of suitors coming out of a powerhouse NorCal high school, but it's hard for teams to pay a big price for a small, high school second basemen, so he matriculated to Oregon State. He's been electric there for three years, posting big numbers and maturing physically while fine-tuning his game. 

Madrigal was off to a raucous start in 2018 before fracturing his wrist in a benign-looking homeplate collision, scaring some teams that are worried about durability due to his small frame. He missed about two months, but still hit .395/.460/.560 over the course of the year while playing elite defense at second base, especially around the bag. Madrigal is a complete, do-everything player once you look past his size and could be in the big leagues as soon as 2019 because of how polished his skillset is. He likely goes 4th to the White Sox or 5th to the Reds.","tQxQekapA8k",""
"3","60","SF/2","Joey Bart","C","21.5","6' 3""","225","R","R","Georgia Tech","","50","Med","Bart was a known high school prospect in the Atlanta suburbs and, though a few teams nearly met it, his price tag pushed him to Tech where he's grown into one of this draft's top talents. He has elite feel for the position, projecting as an impact defender with a 65-grade arm despite being bigger than most good defensive ctachers. He also does advance work for every game, calls area scouts for gameplan input, and is possibly the only catcher at a major program that calls his own games. Scouts rave about his makeup.

Offensively, Bart has huge power and has hit some tape measure shots, including a ball that went over the football facility roof in left field at Georgia Tech and still hasn’t been found. He isn’t the most selective hitter and doesn’t have the loosest swing in the class, but he has some feel for the bat head and doesn’t have trouble with velocity. His power and fly-ball based approach along with these issues mean he could be a 40 or 45 bat with about an average walk rate and anywhere from 50 to 60 game power. Some of his strikeouts this year were a result of getting pitched around. He's seen a lot of off-speed pitches and has altered his approach to hit what he was facing, which likely won’t be a big issue in pro ball.

Since Bart is so advanced defensively, some scouts have speculated that he’ll go straight to High-A and could debut in the big leagues in late 2019. This could make him one of those prospects that gets to the big leagues before the holes to his offensive game have been closed because he's so good at everything else. The Giants have been all over Bart all spring and are expected to take him 2nd overall, but he's also a candidate to go 1st if Mize's medical or bonus demands become problematic.","Cozg_YSvag0",""
"4","71","PIT/10","Travis Swaggerty","CF","20.8","5' 11""","180","L","L","South Alabama","","50","High","Swaggerty was a new name to most scouts last summer when he starred as the sparkplug for collegiate Team USA, playing center field and batting atop the lineup along with Madrigal. Swaggerty showed bat control and gap power, and was a fringe first rounder for many off that first, extended look, but he came out this spring looking like a different player. He had become more physical and changed his swing to incorporate his added strength, lifting the ball and evolving from a gap-to-gap speed player into a potential monster with plus raw power, arm strength and speed. 

Swaggerty didn't put up the gaudy numbers you'd expect for a guy with top level tools in a mid-major conference and who had a summer of good performance with wood bats against strong competition, because Swaggerty's new swing would get out of whack. His weight transfer was too aggressive at times, causing him to lose balance andbe in a poor position to hit. He was hot fearly in the year, then had another hot streak in April, but some high level evaluators (and us) saw him multiple times only during intermittent slumps, which could make it tough for teams to pick him early when the stats and your eyes both say that hit tool is questionablel. We think at least average offense is in there, Swaggerty just needs to dial in the swing mechanics and an approach that takes best advantage of his tools, which are arguably tops in the class. Swaggerty seemed like a likely top-5 overall pick but it sounds like he may slide out of the top 6 due to some uneven late season games.","qTYA7IA0cCQ",""

His swing is too contact-oriented. Many college programs emphsize contact-oriented swings because college defenses are bad and the bats allow you to hit for power anyway. Bohm would likely benefit, long-term, from a swing that better loads his hands to take advantage of his strength and that lets him extend his arms more. This would likely cost him some contact ability, but he has a 9% K rate this year due in part to surprising feel to hit, so there's lots of room for more whiffs before they become an issue.

While currently athletic enough to stay at third, Bohm's broad frame is likely to add some weight over the next few years, and he may have to move down the defensive spectrum. This, plus an projected swing change, mean more of Bohm's profile exists in abstraction than is typical for this kind of college performer. The Phillies zeroed in on Bohm early in the spring and are the favorites to select him.","GOKNy9Trues",""

At times this spring he's sat 93-97 mph in the early innings of his starts while flashing a plus-plus curveball, above-average changeup and newly-minted, average slider. 

Though he's also had spurts where he's been an erratic 88-92 mph and relied on tricks like quick pitches, Liberatore has arguably been the most consistent high school pitcher in the country and tops that category on our board. The Giants were in heavy to see him early on, but now his likely range of selection seems to be in the 7-13 range.","IayXSFEwcVU",""

His body, defense and ability to hit breaking balls all backed up this spring, but most of the industry thinks these things are fixable or insignificant. Gorman's long hand path should be relatively easy for pro coaches to fix and a pro conditioning program should make him viable at third as long as Gorman works at it, and teams buy that he has the makeup to do it. As long as Gorman identifies pro breaking balls, his huge raw power -- visually, scouts have 70s on it but Gorman's summer exit velos were top of the scale for his age -- will play in games. He should be off the board after pick 8 or 9.","_2qk0vq7IEA",""

Kelenic ended up on a youth travel team called Hitters Baseball which played lots of weekend games at any of three facilities near Kenosha and in Cedar Rapids. The concentration of opposing talent in these games was sufficient enough that teams thought Kelenic reinforced what they saw from him as an underclassman. He's a selective hitter with all-fields doubles power and a chance to stay in center field.

Kelenic is almost 19 and already quite physically mature, each considered negatives by the scouting community, but he comes with a long track record most prep hitters do not. Opinions vary regarding Kelenic's physical projection and how it might affect his power output and ultimate defensive home, but Kelenic's bat is stable enough that he's one of the higher-floor high school prospects. With few college hitters in the mid-first round mix, Kelenic could be considered a viable, slightly toolsier alternative to college hitting as early as pick #6.","LFdX2RZaB64",""

He didn't make much progress his first two years. India arrived on campus a fringy defensive shortstop, became a generic defender at third and slightly above-average college hitter. But that all changed this year. India got in better shape and his tools improved as well: he now has 55 raw power and is an above average defensive third baseman that could play a passable middle infield. In addition to the tool and body composition improvements, India made some subtle adjustments to his approach at the plate and they paid off in a big way, with gaudy power numbers. While nothing he does is plus, India offers clubs a high probability, 2 to 3 win, everyday third baseman. He forced himself much higher on our board than we could have imagined he would at the start of the spring.","KPK-GaBvm6U",""

Entering the year, Stewart was a lanky projection arm that sat 88-92 mph and, if his velocity jumped into the mid-90's like scouts were predicting, he'd move into the first half of round one. That's exactly what happened. Stewart came out of the gates strong and in the middle of the spring was regularly sitting 92-96, hitting 98 mph and flashing a 70 curveball, as well as other starter traits. His finish to the spring was rough as he dealt with a minor injury and he had a couple starts where he topped at 94 mph after sitting there weeks before. Some scouts don't like his on-mound demeanor. Stewart still offers perhaps arguably the highest upside among the prep arms and didn't really have any blemishes on his resume until the last month, so she should still go in the top 10-12 picks, unless clubs are out on prep arms altogether due to preceived risk.","VPPae4eCvXg",""

Though his build is somewhat soft and he lacks physical projection, he has the prototypical pitcher's frame, a good delivery and plenty of present stuff and feel. Winn's fastball has flat plane and lives up in the zone, which nicely compliments his 12-6, snapdragon curveball which flashes plus and has a plus spin rate. He's also the best high school sequencer in the draft, able to locate any of his offspeed pitches in various effective locations and throw them for strikes to start at-bats. He projects as an above-average big league starter and is relatively polished for a prep arm, so he could move quickly. There's a 'rumor flying around about an underslot deal with the Giants at pick #2, but otherwise he's likely in the mix starting at pick 8.","JTWvLDwruWs",""

If sneaky plus-plus raw power exists, Larnach has it, as he generates it without taking max-effort hacks. There are teams that don't like Larnach in this range because they think he's a bad defender and/or they are concerned about his 20% strikeout rate, But Larnach's career 15% walk rate should help satiate the stat-driven people in draft rooms and his power numbers could take a jump if pro instruction coaxes more lift out of his swing. He checks every box for the risk-averse, analytics-driven clubs, which means he has a lot of potential homes in the 10-20 range.","U7sjFBR3DkI",""

The Blue Jays took him in the 2nd round. Negotiations broke down and Singer went to Florida where he was a standout from day one. There's plenty to pick apart here if you want to: his stuff still isn't loud, he doesn't get many whiffs from pro level hitters, his delivery turns off some scouts and his breaking ball is often fringy. Even scouts that like Singer think he has limited upside, but you can't argue with the results he has gotten in the SEC for several years and with his long track record of health. He has feel for pitching and a bulldog mentality, performing at the highest levels of amateur baseball. There's interest in Singer at multiple picks in the top 5, with Cincinnati at 5 the most rumored spot. He should move quickly and could be in a big league rotation in 2019.","zr81CO4HyzY",""

Wilcox is a good athlete who repeats his (non-traditional) delivery and has plus control, but you can't project his stuff to improve much because his frame is maxed out. On the bright side, his stuff is already plenty good, sitting 92-94 with above average life most days, and running up to 98 mph in a heavily-scouted playoff matchup with Kumar Rocker that Wilcox ended up winning. Wilcox also has a nasty, plus changeup that he'll use even against poor prep hitters that can't catch up to his fastball, and his changeup moves so much they still can't hit it. His slider was an above average to plus pitch in the summer and, with a slightly different grip this spring, the pitch has been more average to slightly above. It's still effective against right handed hitters. 

Wilcox will need a slight delivery adjustment to fix his direction to the plate but otherwise, along with Cole Winn, offers something close to a finished product that just needs to make small improvements. Some scouts pick apart Wilcox's delivery and arm action but there's some cognitive dissonance there as both are better than Casey Mize's and Wilcox, right now, looks something like what Mize looked like a year ago. There's plenty of teams showing lots of interest in the 10-20 range and the rumored $3 million price tag will likely be met.","mUKE04zP5UU",""

His stuff has waxed and waned this spring, but when it's good, Weathers has arguably the best present three-pitch mix and pitch usage in the class. He's a short-strider, so the fastball is going to play down a bit due to poor extension, but otherwise he projects as a mid-rotation arm due to the quality of his secondaries, and is, potentially, a quick-moving one.

He came back last week after he missing a month with biceps tendinitis and while the curveball wasn't all the way back (expected), his changeup took center stage, flashing above average and striking out Triston Casas twice in the region final. As important as the pure quality Denaburg's breaking stuff is, his ability to keep it down beneath the strike zone, and to his glove side is also significant. He'll be able to attack both-handed hitters in that spot as soon as he steps on a pro mound. He's a high-ceiling high school arm who had some injury problems this spring.

His season finally began in early April, then was put on hold on April 23rd when Vasil left his start with an arm injury. He returned after a month and was 93-96 in his first start back. Shortly thereafter, Vasil, whose adviser is his father, announced via Twitter that he was withdrawing from the draft and going to Virginia.

Like Madrigal, Edwards faces questions about his size, but power isn't part of his game and doesn't project to be. Instead, Edwards is a high-effort offensive catalyst who knifes at defenses with line drives and well-placed bunts. If you were picking teams for a schoolyard game among this year's high school crop, Edwards goes first.

Turang looked like the best player in the class until last summer when he suddenly looked lethargic and uncomfortable at the plate. He's been better this spring, but not so great that concerns about his developmental direction have been quelled.

A shoulder injury limited Murray to DH'ing as a senior in high school and Murray formally opted out of the draft by refusing to submit to MLB's pre-draft medical disclosure. He went to A&M but split time with Kyle Allen as a freshman. Each of them transferred, Murray to Oklahoma, where he backed up Heisman winner and #1 overall pick, Baker Mayfield. For much of this time, Murray wasn't playing baseball.

Football at A&M and the time missed due to NCAA transerring rules limited Murray to 64 college plate appearances before this season. Despite it, he has been electric, showing even more physical ability than he had in high school and performing, slashing .290/.390/.550. He shows everything scouts could want to see after this kind of layoff and his only clear weakness is swing-and-miss against good off-speed stuff, both somewhat allowed with his power-based approach. And even more forgiveable when you consider he hasn't seen good pitching on a regular basis at any point in his baseball career. Given these factors, there's a reasonable chance he may be able to close that hole in his game with reps.

Murray is projected, but not a lock, to win Oklahoma's QB job in the fall. Teams aren't sure how much it would take to get him to give up football or if there's even a number that would do it, but some teams are kicking around multi-million dollar offers to see if they can buy him out. Given his size, baseball likely offers the most financial upside unless he's a Heisman level performer this year. With some recent changes to the CBA, spreading a bonus over 5 years and letting him play football (like the Blue Jays did with CF Anthony Alford) isn't really an option anymore.","xmMP-OHxKp8",""

This spring he started, as many pitchers do, a couple ticks lower but instead of getting back to his old velocity, it continued to slip amid a number of high pitch count outings. Gilbert has taken the ball every week and has performed well, with velocity ranging from 88-91, touching 92 mph in some starts, and sitting 90-94, touching 95 in others, including his last few before regionals.

The command, frame and athleticism are stable constants, so he'll still go comfortably in the first round, but there isn't a clear reason for the velo drop. Some scouts are speculating it's a small injury that won't keep him from pitching right now, but shutting him down may bring the velo back next spring. Others think Gilbert would (as many pitchers do) lose a few ticks under a pro workload and become this guy in a few years anyway.

Scott is a superior athlete to Tucker, as Scott has been into the mid-90's on the mound with three average or better pitches and 70 speed that profiles in center field. Scott doesn't appear to like pitching so scouts haven't seen him throw much, but he's easily a top-5 round prospect on the hill. While he's played in some high-profile prep games around Tampa (mostly for scouts who are based in the area), Scott only went to a few national events this summer.

This, combined with a number of minor spring injuries (hamstring and concussion the most notable) have made Scott hard for decision makers to see, and thus slid him down around the 20's rather than around 10, where his tools belong alongside Kelenic and Gorman at the top of the class. Some scouts that got positive preseason looks predicted Scott would be this year's Austin Beck and shoot into the top 10 picks, but that likely won't happen. It's unclear if this uneven track record is predictive of Scott not hitting his upside, but some teams are treating it that way and we also simply didn't get enough looks to pound the table in the top half of the first round.","0xcsCdAtkPM",""

It's obvious from observing Lynch that he isn't a fan of the Virginia pitching style, its characteristic mechanics and reliance on breaking balls. Most scouts have viewed this as positive as they aren't a fan of it or UVA's overall track record with pitching (Hultzen, Kirby, Jones, etc.) either and like that Lynch knows how he wants to pitch. He throws a cutter, slider, curveball and changeup that all flash above-average, with his slider occasionally flashing plus. Lynch, like many college pitchers including Florida's Brady Singer, doesn't throw his changeup much but it shows enough promise that it could be an above-average pitch with greater use.

As the summer wore on, Seigler was chosen as the backup catcher for Team USA and quickly took the starting job from fellow Georgia prep catcher, Will Banfield, due to his innate present feel for contact at the plate and receiving behind it. 

This spring he's steadily moved up boards, into the late first round area, because Seigler has been putting the bat on the ball and lifting it in games against top Georgia high school competition. Seigler is an average runner with an awkward gait, but even if he loses a step as he ages he'll still be an above-average athlete for the position. Some teams don't like the horrendous track record of prep catchers and have considered moving Seigler to an infield spot in pro ball, but most would not since he's already so advanced, defensively. His plus arm and active framing and receiving reminds some of M.J. Melendez from last year's draft, but Seigler is more advanced offensively, though a bit less twitchy. The Royals took Melendez last year and are the most interested team in Seigler, along with the Dodgers (who love multi-positional, athletic catchers), Braves and D'Backs. Seigler's mother is Navajo.

The two issues for Kowar are his very short stride, which causes his velocity to play down and secondly, his breaking ball. It's never been good and it got close to average with the velo spike improving his arm speed, but it's still most often a below average pitch, with curveball velocity and three-quarters slider shape.

A good pitching program may be able to tweak the pitch using TrackMan or Rapsodo in a pitch design type setting, or just scrap it altogether and try something like a cutter or slider. This is almost an identical issue to what Luke Weaver had coming out of Florida State and he's largely solved it with the help of a good pitching program with the Cardinals, so the team that picks Kowar could have a bigger influence in his outcome than most comparable talents.","6Gnu6dq3LLQ",""

There's some swing and miss risk here, which is particularly troubling if you don't like Groshans' hands and think he ends up in right field, but the tools package is electric and he could be selected in the middle of round 1 and probably doesn't get out of the comp round.","f-TuuK1yB5k",""

Since then, Rocker has filled out considerably at roughly 6'5/250, taking after his father Tracy, a former NFL defensive tackle who is the defensive line coach for Tennessee. Rocker topped out at 99 mph over the summer and has been considered a first round pick for years, but had his worst outing of the spring in his last outing, losing a playoff matchip to Cole Wilcox. At his best this spring, Rocker would sit 93-96, hitting 98 mph with a hellacious two-plane slider that was a 65 or 70 pitch for most scouts. His changeup wasn't needed much but flashed average at times and his command was average with control a hair better than that, though some scouts don't love his mechanics.

The questions on Rocker were 1) maintaining his current physique 2) maintaining his athleticism to repeat his delivery and stay a starter and 3) having enough feel to pitch and deception to flourish when he doesn't have his premium stuff. Rocker was often pitching on a week or more of rest this spring, so scouts didn't see diminished stuff until the Wilcox outing, when Rocker was sitting mostly 90-93 mph, dipping into the high 80's in the 4th inning with a breaking ball that was a 50 or 55. His command wasn't as good that day and Rocker was hit around some, visibly frustrated. Granted that was one outing, but it could be considered a concern about a prep pitcher with no physical projection that will likely lose a tick or two of velocity as he matures.","i9ljeJlzB5A",""

He's had an up-and-down spring, coming out of the chute blazing hot, leading to top-10 pick momentum for the first month of the season, then slowly regressing in performance, fastball command and changeup usage. Most scouts think Rolison needs a delivery adjustment in pro ball to make himself more online to the plate as a way to improve his fastball command. That would likely tease out a bit more performance from Rolison's above-average stuff, but he's been too reliant on his plus curveball. To that point, hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch, knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and he barely threw his changeup, including his disastrous outing at South Carolina where he allowed 11 runs.

He projects for plus raw power and has been getting to it in games. That said, many of his homers this spring, against middling competition, have been to the opposite field and some scouts are worried that a deep hand load/arm bar is making him late on less-than-premium stuff rather than him showing impressive opposite field game power.

Schnell also has a bit of a medical history, with a multi-sport background that includes multiple concussions and numerous other lesser injuries. The upside here is 5 hit and 6 everything else which is considerable and many draft models give extra credit to hitters from Northern states that are young for the class and Schnell is both.

In the past, this has happened to hitters like Jason Heyward and Braxton Davidson. Casas was a 2019 prospect that reclassified to the 2018 class where he's now of roughly of average age for the class. He's appealed mostly to more analytical teams due to his track record of hitting and the big exit velos he posts, due to his power and fly ball-oriented swing. Casas' cut is designed to tap into his top-of-the-scale raw power and he often does, when he swings.

He plays third base now and has a 55 arm that gets into the low 90's on the mound, but he's limited athletically and laterally, fitting at first base only long-term. Some clubs see Casas' mature approach and see a 6 hit, 6 or 7 power future monster that is the rare high school first baseman worth a first round pick while others see a fringy hitter that sells out for power and beats up on non pro-level pitching. There's enough interest that Casas could go as high as 13 and likely finds a spot in the top 30-35 picks.","900T_ozI7iY",""

Scouts were buzzing in the fall and just before the spring, seeing McClanahan up to 100 mph with two above average offspeed pitches, but still questioned if he was a starter or reliever. In his first start of the year, McClanahan dominated North Carolina and the consensus is that he would go in the top 5 picks. Things slowly unraveled from there, missing some starts with an illness or a cut on his finger from cutting a slice of bread, showing well below-average command and inconsistent off-speed pitches in other outings. Last week at the conference tournament in front of tons of heat and 2 GMs, McClanahan barely threw any changeups, many of his breaking balls were below average and his command was well below. There may be some teams that think a change of scenery and coaching may tease out those starter traits again, but most clubs (and us) think he's a reliever whose only consistent positive characteristic has been velocity.","ntk-CU1Bo6A",""

He came out of the gates this spring a little rusty then walked off the mound with shoulder tightness tied to a muscle behind the joint. He returned over a month later and has been good down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer, as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games this spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt, but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for the pitch anymore.

The curveball that replaced it is similar to Brady Singer's curveball and is often a 45 or 50, maybe a 55 once a start but not often enough to project it as such. He's healthy, teams are clearing his medical and the arm speed is back, but his frame is now maxed-out and it's unclear where his breaking ball went and if it will come back. He's seen as very signable and the team that takes him will be banking on him returning to form; we've assumed there's a little more slider feel that will be teased out but not the 60 pitch of the summer.","LrEeDHttijE",""
