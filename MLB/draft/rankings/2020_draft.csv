After he hit a combined .336/.445/.722 as a freshman and sophomore, Tork was off to a ridiculous .340/.598/.780 start as a junior and was leading the country in walks. He has sublime hitter's timing, plus bat speed, and above-average barrel control and ball/strike recognition, really only struggling with breaking balls located beneath the zone, which may be easy to remedy with a slightly longer stride. Tork only fits as a 1B, as he body comps to Yankees 1B Luke Voit. It's a tough profile, but his track record and tools, which are very similar to Andrew Vaughn's, are sufficient to generate confidence and top-of-the-draft enthusiasm anyway. Torkelson is probably going to move very quickly through the minors and be a thumping, heart of the order hitter.","3Q4wD3EV960",
"2","48","KCR/4","Asa Lacy","LHP","21.0111111","6' 4""","215","L","L","Texas A&M",,"50",,"Lacy presents scouts with a non-traditional mechanical look which makes his delivery look pretty violent about his head and shoulder, even though he has less of a head whack now than he did in high school and as an underclassman. While his delivery creates some visual relief risk, there is none regarding the pitch mix. Laxy's the slot creates backspin on the fastball that enables it to have big carry at the top of the zone, his slider has remarkable length for how hard it is, and when Lacy gets on top of his curveball it has huge, bat-missing depth. The deilvery also disorients hitters who take lots of bad, awkward swings at pitches that live in the middle of the zone. His changeup (which Lacy sets up with a two-seamer) is occasionally good-looking, and might be a real out pitch if it's re-emphasized in pro ball. ","fKeDYi5Wzzo",

He already had two traits that together make for a strong profile in that Martin is likely to play a premium position (though where exactly is up for debate, his arm was not great early in 2020 and he moved from 3B to CF) and has a plus-plus feel for the strike zone. He had more walks than strikeouts as a sophomore and started hitting for power late in that season, something his combination of selectivity and gorgeous, natural swing loft give him an excellent chance of doing in pro ball despite middling raw juice. Martin doesn't have huge physical tools at first blush, but he is a sneaky plus runner and should be fine in center field whether playing there full time or as part of a multi-positional package. ",,

He sits in the mid-90s and will flash a plus changeup and slider, both of which live in the 82-85mph range. He has the prototypical power pitcher's build, delivery, and stuff, he throws strikes and had a 30-to-2 strikeout to walk ratio in his final three starts of 2020 after that rough opener.

His in-the-box actions are quiet and smooth up until the moment he decides to unleash hell on the baseball. He can clear his hips and crush balls in and he can also extends his arms and crush pitches away from him to the opposite field gap. Because of the frame-based power potential, Veen was one of the handful of high schoolers who had a chance to really blow up during his senior spring and insert himself among the college prospects atop this draft, and because high school ball began in Florida before the COVID-19 outbreak, teams got to see some of that development and Veen separated himself from the other prep outfielders more clearly.

Instead, it's his 2019 Cape Cod line -- .351/.451/.630 -- and algorithms that can better estimate Gonzales' realistic output by utilizing hit data that will carry his statistical case in draft rooms. Visual evaluations of Gonzales suggest he has a chance to both play a premium defensive position and hit for a lot of power, though Gonzales lacks fundamental consistency on defense. He will botch some routine plays and make some spectacular ones, at times looking like a passable middle infielder and others like he belongs in the outfield. If he can stay on the MIF Gonzales might be a star. He has the most explosive hitting hands in the draft among college hitters not named Spencer Torkelson, hands that work a lot like Nationals prospect Carter Kieboom's do. There's certainly more statistical volatility here than is typical for a college hitter, and where Gonzales fits on teams' boards in the top then might depend on how well he played defense when their decision-makers saw him.",,
"7","110","BAL/2","Heston Kjerstad","RF","21.3166666","6' 3""","215","S","R","Arkansas",,"50",,"Kjerstad has performed against the best pitching in the country since he set foot on campus, and in 150 career games with Arkansas he hit .343/.421/.590, including a white hot .448/.513/.791 in 2020, during which Kjerstad hit in all sixteen games he played. He's kept his big, 6-foot-3 frame lean and speedy during that time, relevant for the corner-only prospect because Kjerstad puts a lot of balls in play down both baselines and runs well enough to turn them all into extra bases. He can drop the bat head and lift balls at his knees, and also get on top of pitches at the top of the zone. It's plus bat control on a somewhat odd-looking swing. If there are concerns about Kjerstad's cut, I'm not hearing them, they're drowned out by how well he's performed. He may have been about to have a year like J.J. Bleday's 2019 in which he clearly establishes himself as the most reliable tier 2 college hitter in the draft, and teams in the top 10 may view him as such.","m8q8iZiuC60",

He proceeded to dismantle TCU (10 K in 5.2 IP), North Carolina (CG, 1 BB, 14 K), and Utah (8 IP, 15 K) in the following three weeks before the shutdown, mostly with the fastball/slider combo. Meyer's stuff and command has backed up later in starts and he doesn't have a fully formed starter's mix yet, but he's arguably the best athlete among college starters in this class.",,

He has the prototype starter's frame at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-4, he already throws hard and might throw harder as that frame fills out, he has strong natural proclivity for spinning his breaking stuff, and he'll also flash a really good changeup once in a while. His sitting fastball velocity slipped throughout his showcase summer while Jared Kelley's did not, but Abel was still reaching back for 97 early in outings and the rest of his profile is more complete than other pre arms. His location and the timing of the COVID-19 shutdown mean Abel didn't pitch in varsity games this spring, but he threw deeper into the fall than most of his peers in the preceding few years and might actually benefit from the extra rest, especially after what happened to his velo throughout last summer.","Eqc625r-XdY",
"10",,"LAA/10","Reid Detmers","LHP","20.9111111","6' 2""","210","L","L","Louisville",,"45+",,"Detmers' curveball is hell's rainbow, especially for left-handed hitters who think it's headed for their lips, bail, and watch it bend into the zone. There's some doubt about it playing in pro ball the way it has in college both because it's a slower pitch in the mid-70s and because its huge arc is easy to see out of his hand. Righty batters can wait forever before making a decision against the curveball but it's still been tough for college bats to touch because it has such cartoonish depth. He also works his heater in on the hands of righties and can run it off their hip and back into the zone for looking strikes. That approach with those two pitches has largely enabled Detmers to strike out 284 hitters in 191 career innings. He's a higher variance prospect than is typical for a college pitcher who has performed like this, because even if you buy that Detmers' fastball and curveball will play in the big leagues he needs a clearer third pitch, which will probably be a changeup. I'm a little more skeptical than what I perceive the industry median to be, but still think Detmers has a better chance to start or has been healthier than the other college ptchers in this tier.","mk06YYkpDQk",

That pitching is much better than what Howard would have seen in Illinois this spring. Howard best squares up pitches at the bottom of the strike zone, and although he hasn't been tested regularly at the letters, he's shown flashes of being able to either lay off those pitches, or pull his hands in and find a way to get the barrel there, and even to catch that high pitch way out in front of the plate and hit it in the air to his pull side. Whether Howard is able to fo that against big league velocity is tough to predict, but he has promising feel to hit and an advance approach for a cold weather hitter, as well as perhaps the best defensive footwork in the entire class. He projects as an everday big league shortstop.",,

He's a capable hitter from both sides of the plate, utilizing a gap approach from the right side and more of a pull/lift one from the left. He's a fine receiver and blocker, catching on one knee until a runner reaches base. Most of Bailey's good pop times rest around 1.95, which is about average. He has a very good chance to be an everyday catcher but likely lacks the offensive impact to be star.",,

It makes him a high-risk prospect, but Hendrick is the most explosive rotator in this whoe class and it really isn't close. He he among the bst raw power projection in the class and it's possible he just needs reps against good pitching, reps he hasn't had as many of coming up in Western Pennsylvania.","ZBiRPVgPvHQ",

Curt, punchy, and geared for gap contact, Mitchell's current cut is more fluid and dynamic than it was in high school, when teams had million-dollar evals on him despite largely taking issue with his swing efficacy, but he still has limited power utility on pitches away from him. The swing changes Mitchell made at UCLA are perhaps evidence he can make more as a pro, but I think this gap approach works fine and is best depoyed by sprinters like Mitchell, who has retained his plus-plus speed despite bulking up quite a bit since high school. Without impact game power Mitchell is unlikely to be a star, but the offensive improvements he made in college combined with his defensive fit in center give him a good shot to be an everyday center fielder.",,

It's particularly inpressive considering he was a two-way varsity player. Somewhat stiff in the lower half, Hassell is more of a long-striding glider in center field and lacks the pure speed to be an impact defender there. Some teams have him projected in a corner spot but think, even though he doesn't necessarily project to have big power at maturity, that he'll hit enough to profile there. For context, he's a half grade beneath where I had Corbin Carroll evaluated last year (45+ FV)",,

That window was closed due to the pandemic, and so teams' opinions of Bitsko are going to be driven by what they saw last year (he was 92-96 in front of heavy-hitting eyeballs at East Coast Pro) and, in the case of some teams, what they saw in the bullpen just before the shutdown. In both instances, Bitsko's arm strength, curveball, and touch-and-feel command were on par with first round high school arms, though that demographic's track record is scary and being devalued by teams. That, combined with the possibility that some teams won't be comfortable taking a player they've barely seen, makes Bitsko's stock pretty volatile.","jTQS49gZv44",

In his four 2020 starts Cavalli was electric, routinely sitting in the mid-90s and touching above, locating a late-breaking, mid-80s slider, and even getting some chases on a hard, sinking changeup. He still spikes too many of those changeups but, again, Cavalli hasn't pitched a whole lot so the cambio and other minutae could come later. ",,
"18",,"SDP/80","Cole Wilcox","RHP","20.8944444","6' 5""","230","R","R","Georgia",,"45",,"Wilcox pitched out of the bullpen throughout much of his freshman year and was routinely sitting 97-99 in that role, often touching 100. As a starter in 2020 Wilcox was sitting 93-96 with more consistent command (he walked no hitters in his final three starts and walked just two in 23 total innings) than he had as a freshman, and more effective slider shape. When it's right, Wilcox has a biting, two-plane out pitch in the slide piece, which sits in the 85-89 range and often has more length than any pitch that hard has a right to be. Those two pitches and his current command would be enough to project Wilcox in a late-inning bullpen role, but a better change or split (the development of which was slowed by his freshman role) would enable him to be a mid-rotation piece so long as he retains his velo in pro ball, since the shape of the heater makes it velo-dependent.","mUKE04zP5UU",

He came out as a starter in 2020 and was electric, sitting in the mid-90s with two plus, or better, breaking balls. His fastball has big carry thanks to its backspinning axis, and it works similar to the way Nick Anderson's does, as do his breaking balls. He's a candidate for immediate placement on a taxi squad during the 2020 season and could pitch out of a big league bullpen this year if he throws strikes in whatever developmental environment MLB puts in place.

He made lots of quality contact during his showcase summer and is one of the more polished high school hitters in this draft. Juxtaposing his advanced offense is Soderstrom's defense. He split time behind the plate on his high school team, then was asked to catch premium stuff from pitchers with whom he had no experience during his showcase summer. I think we've only seen the tip of his defensive iceberg, but working to develop SOderstrom glove probably means slowing the development of his bat, and exposing him to the brutal grind of catching which often dilutes offensive production.

Over two years at Miami (he's an eligible sophomore) his arm strength returned and he is once again living in the mid-90s while incorporating a slider with variable shape (it has very nasty two-plane break when it's well-located), and a lesser (but viable) change and cutter.",,

In his one appearance Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 and flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams value him (relief risk, injury or makeup issues) is highly variable but those focused on his pitch data think he has among the best raw stuff in the class and is one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen.","B6TbAPJuzyA",

This season his velo climbed into 93-94 area without sacrificing any command and his changeup was consistently plus. From a pitch movement demarcation standpoint, Jarvis does things a lot of progressive teams really like, and his breaking ball is likely to perform above its raw raw grade because of how well it's located.

Crow-Armstrong did, however, come out having added substantial muscle and some teams think he'll hit for more power than the industry would have projected based on 2019 looks.
